# Enhanced Test Recorder with TTS Feedback

## Overview

The test recorder has been significantly enhanced with TTS (Text-to-Speech) audio feedback, transcription validation, and intelligent audio processing capabilities to provide a comprehensive testing experience for voice command development.

## New Features

### 🔊 TTS Audio Feedback
- **Real-time guidance**: Audio instructions for what to do next
- **Recording announcements**: Spoken confirmation when recording starts/stops
- **Validation feedback**: Audio feedback on transcription quality
- **Error notifications**: Spoken error messages and corrections
- **Toggle capability**: Can enable/disable TTS feedback via voice command

### 🎯 Transcription Validation
- **Automatic validation**: Transcribes recorded audio and compares to expected phrase
- **Similarity scoring**: Calculates percentage match between expected and actual transcription
- **Quality assessment**: Determines if recording is good enough for testing (≥80% similarity)
- **Manual validation**: Command to re-validate last recording

### 🎵 Intelligent Audio Processing
- **Enhanced trimming**: More aggressive silence removal for cleaner test files
- **Clean file generation**: Creates optimized test files specifically for parser testing
- **Quality control**: Validates audio content before saving
- **Dual file output**: Both original and cleaned versions available

## New Voice Commands

### Recording Control
- `"start test recording next"` - Start recording the next phrase with TTS guidance
- `"start test recording [number]"` - Start recording specific phrase with audio announcement
- `"stop test recording"` - Stop and save with automatic validation

### Validation & Quality Control
- `"validate last recording"` - Check transcription quality of last recording
- `"clean and save test file"` - Create optimized version for parser testing

### System Control
- `"toggle tts feedback"` - Enable/disable audio feedback

## Enhanced Workflow

### 1. Startup
```
🎙️ Enhanced Test Recorder initialized
🔊 "Enhanced test recorder initialized. Audio feedback is enabled."
🎯 Current phrase displayed with audio announcement
```

### 2. Recording Process
```
User: "start test recording next"
🔊 "Recording phrase 1. Please say: enable vad"
🔴 Recording started...
User says: "enable vad"
User: "stop test recording"
✅ Recording saved with automatic transcription
📝 Transcription: "enable vad"
🎯 Expected: "enable vad"  
📈 Similarity: 100.0%
🔊 "Good recording! Expected 'enable vad', got 'enable vad'"
```

### 3. Quality Assessment
```
✅ Good recording! Ready for testing.
🔊 "Next phrase is number 2. Say 'start test recording next' when ready."
```

### 4. Clean File Generation
```
User: "clean and save test file"
✨ Clean test file created: clean_test_001_enable_vad.wav
🔊 "Clean test file created: clean_test_001_enable_vad.wav"
```

## Technical Implementation

### TTS Service (`src/services/tts.rs`)
- Cross-platform TTS using the `tts` crate
- Async/await support for non-blocking audio feedback
- Configurable voice settings (rate, volume)
- Graceful fallback when TTS unavailable

### Enhanced Recording State
```rust
struct RecordingState {
    // ... existing fields ...
    last_recording_path: Option<String>,
    last_transcription: Option<String>,
    validation_score: Option<f32>,
}
```

### Validation Functions
- `transcribe_audio_file()` - Transcribes saved WAV files
- `calculate_transcription_similarity()` - Word-based similarity scoring
- `create_clean_test_file()` - Generates optimized test files

## File Outputs

### Original Recordings
- `phrase_001_enable_vad.wav` - Original recording with basic trimming
- Standard 16kHz mono WAV format
- Automatic silence trimming

### Clean Test Files  
- `clean_test_001_enable_vad.wav` - Optimized for parser testing
- More aggressive silence removal
- Consistent audio levels
- Minimal file size while preserving quality

## Usage Examples

### Basic Testing Session
```bash
# Build the enhanced recorder
cargo build --bin test_recorder

# Run with TTS feedback
WHISPER_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/model.bin ./target/debug/test_recorder
```

### Sample Session Flow
1. **Start**: TTS announces current phrase
2. **Record**: Voice command starts recording with audio guidance
3. **Validate**: Automatic transcription and quality assessment
4. **Optimize**: Generate clean test file if needed
5. **Continue**: TTS guides to next phrase

### Testing Parser Integration
```rust
// Use clean test files for automated testing
let test_audio = load_audio("test_recordings/clean_test_001_enable_vad.wav");
let result = voice_parser.parse(&test_audio);
assert_eq!(result.command, "enable_vad");
```

## Benefits for Development

### 🎯 Improved Testing Accuracy
- Real-time validation ensures high-quality test data
- Consistent audio format for reliable parser testing
- Immediate feedback on recording quality

### 🚀 Enhanced Productivity  
- Audio guidance reduces need to read instructions
- Hands-free operation for better workflow
- Automatic progression through test phrases

### 🔧 Better Test Data
- Clean test files optimized for parser accuracy
- Validated transcriptions ensure expected behavior
- Consistent audio quality across all test files

### 📊 Quality Assurance
- Similarity scoring identifies problematic recordings
- Multiple validation options (automatic and manual)
- Clear feedback on what needs improvement

## Future Enhancements

- **Batch processing**: Process multiple recordings at once
- **Custom similarity thresholds**: Adjustable quality requirements
- **Export capabilities**: Generate test suites in various formats
- **Performance metrics**: Track recording session statistics
- **Voice training**: Adapt to user's speech patterns

## Dependencies Added

```toml
# Text-to-Speech for testing feedback
tts = "0.26"
```

The enhanced test recorder provides a comprehensive, audio-guided testing experience that significantly improves the quality and efficiency of voice command development and testing.
