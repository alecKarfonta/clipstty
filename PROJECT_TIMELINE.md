#### Risk 2: Integration Complexity in Phase 8
**Probability**: High (60%)  
**Impact**: High  
**Timeline Risk**: 3-4 weeks delay

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Regular integration testing throughout development
- Modular architecture with clear interfaces
- Dedicated integration testing in each phase
- Early proof-of-concept integration (Week 16)

**Contingency Plan**:
- Prioritize core features for initial release
- Defer advanced features to post-release updates
- Allocate additional development resources

#### Risk 3: Security Vulnerabilities in Tool Framework
**Probability**: Medium (30%)  
**Impact**: Very High  
**Timeline Risk**: 2-3 weeks delay in Phase 5

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Security-first design from the beginning
- Regular security reviews and code audits
- Penetration testing by external security experts
- Conservative permission model with explicit user consent

**Contingency Plan**:
- Disable tool execution in initial release
- Implement read-only tools first
- Gradual rollout with user feedback

### Medium-Risk Items

#### Risk 4: Performance Issues with Large Datasets
**Probability**: Medium (50%)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Timeline Risk**: 1-2 weeks delay in Phases 3 & 6

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Performance testing with large datasets from Week 6
- Database optimization and indexing strategies
- Caching and lazy loading implementation
- Performance monitoring from the beginning

#### Risk 5: Audio Processing Complexity
**Probability**: Low (20%)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Timeline Risk**: 1-2 weeks delay in Phase 2

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Leverage existing audio processing libraries
- Audio specialist involvement from Week 5
- Prototype audio recording early (Week 4)
- Platform-specific testing and optimization

### Risk Monitoring Schedule

**Weekly Risk Reviews**: Every Friday
**Risk Assessment Updates**: Bi-weekly (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22)
**Go/No-Go Decision Points**: 
- Week 4 (after Phase 1)
- Week 11 (after Phase 4)
- Week 19 (before final integration)
